I'm clearing out my home office setup and have a bunch of items up for sale, including mechanical keyboards, wireless keyboards, mice, cables, monitor stands/arms, and more. Check out [this link](https://airtable.com/apppEwmGwKSgirUI8/shrM0pyQBJfeUHjED) for a complete list of available items. I'm continuously updating the link with new items, so keep an eye on the link even though the post might be old. 
And, if you're looking for specific cables or cable management accessories, do DM me what you're looking for. I have plenty of cables, way too many to list.

**FAQs**
- **How do I contact you?**
  - Start by messaging me on Reddit chat. I prefer Reddit Chat. After finalizing the details, we can switch to Telegram or WhatsApp.
- **Is the item 'X' still available?** 
  - If it's listed in the link and if it's marked as ""Available"", then it is available please don't ask if it's available! 
- **Are the prices final?** 
  - Generally, yes. However, if you are a student I'll knock something off the price. Or if you have read all the FAQs, ask for an FAQ discount.
- **Can you reduce the price of X?** 
  - Generally, No. If you still want to, please be reasonable in your offers. Research on the product, consider its age, and please engage in informed discussions with me. 
- **Are the stuff under warranty?** 
  - I have bills for everything, so you could potentially claim manufacturer's warranty for some of the newer items. 
- **Can I see pictures of the actual product?** 
  - Absolutely, just contact me (as mentioned above) for photos.
- **Can I see item 'X' before I buy?**
  - Yes.
- **How do I pick up the Item?** 
  - Contact me (as mentioned above), and we can co-ordinate.
- **Can you Dunzo it to me?** 
  - You can arrange for a Dunzo pick up. But the risk and cost will be borne by the buyer.
- **Why are some items marked as ""Booked""?** 
  - Items are marked ""Booked"" when someone has agreed to purchase and pick them up by an agreed date. If they don't pick up the item by the agreed date, the item goes back to the ""Available"" pool. 
- **I am interested in a item that is ""Booked"", what do I do?** 
  - If you are still interested in an item and if it's marked as ""Booked"" let me know, I'll DM you if it's become available again. 
- **Can you check your inbox? / Why haven't you replied?** 
  - I check my inbox twice a day. You should receive a reply within 12 hours.
- **Why do you have so many keyboards?** 
  - I'd rather let /r/MechanicalKeyboards, and /r/MKIndia answer that.
- **Why are you selling the keyboards?** 
  - To buy more keyboards!",1705294987.0,False,4,False

(1) I understand how difficult it can be to form friendships. Friendships without any kind of expectations from either side. Yes, I am aware that undertaking things in which you may be interested in can be fun and help you meet new people, but I feel like the aspect of truly building a community or a support system around you is something that many people struggle with (me included). And I am not even consider myself one of the most introverted person out there. 


(2) I also know how daunting life can get under some circumstances. We are all dealing with some kind of shit or the other, and for those of us that are not blessed with an existing set of friends, this shit can get extremely challenging. Paralysing even, I would say. Specially in situations where you need people.


(3) Some of us also do have interests – and quite a lot of them – but going to events or going out by ourselves can feel a little cumbersome. I feel you there, I truly do. God knows the number of events I have had to give up on despite being interested in them because I just felt alone and like I didn’t have anyone to go with.


(4) I also know ‘therapy’ is a much touted option, and people recommend it (have been to it personally). But I feel that the transactional nature of therapy doesn’t really satiate those of us that want people around them to genuinely care about them. It’s also difficult for a lot of people to spend a shit ton of money trying to get someone to understand the extent of their difficulty within 60 minutes worth of time.",1705892816.0,True,2,False

Lots of customization options for the external and internal (if you have an internal camera). Autos are not typically seen as ""sexy"" things to ride so not sure how much gamers would love to drive around one. But customization will add that level of passion (think NFS most wanted)

Also make it fast and add nitro boosters or something. Nobody like to drive slow vehicles.

If you are making a simulator then well my views won't be so applicable. If it's a simulator, then having good rewards system and levelling system would be great.

Work on passenger conversations. As an auto driver I can have interesting conversations and know stories about the city from local people. I can then go to those locations and collect points /awards/hidden upgrades /easter eggs.

Also, you can have a consequence system to actions and conversations you choose to make (think Read dead redemption or Witcher) where every action you make like hitting cars/pedestrians can negatively impact your driver rating /honor whatever you like to call it. And your conversations can have impact to how you thrive in the city.

Have time based challenges where as an auto driver you need to complete missions on time to get rewards while also avoiding hitting pedestrians or vehicles. The missions shouldn't just have pick up and drop of people but also where you have to pick injured people and take them to hospitals in a certain time, drop something important to people or destinations, follow someone (you know in movies how they show hero sits in auto and says follow that car) etc.",1705769214.0,False,2,False

After instilling fear in her by saying that someone had performed black magic on her, the astrologer, along with his associates, cheated her on the pretext of freeing her from the malinfluence. Rahil (name changed) from Jalahalli has filed a complaint against the astrologer, Ahmed, his associates Abdul and Liyakhatulla and others. She also had other problems. She contacted Ahmed on December 9 and shared her problems. After asking her some questions, Ahmed told her that someone had performed black magic on her, her friends and family members due to which she was facing multiple issues. Instructed by him, she sent photos of herself, friends, and family members to Ahmed. She also followed the instruction of Abdul and made a payment of Rs 501 through a digital payment application.
  
>Ahmed also told her that he will perform black magic on her boyfriend and her parents so that they will never oppose her relationship with him and demanded Rs 2.4 lakh for the same. She paid the money in cash to Ahmed's associates near New BEL Road on Dec 22. Two days later, he again got her to pay his associate Rs 1.7 lakh in Hebbal. As Ahmed kept demanding for more money, Rahil suspected something fishy and refused to pay more. Ahmed abused her and threatened to send her photos with her boyfriend to her parents. Rahil ended up paying Rs 4.1 lakh in multiple transactions through a digital payment application till Jan 10.

All the others were pretty chill but sometimes would join her. I love dogs for the most part and I was always confused because if I walked by them they would just be chill and relaxed and never did anything. 

So when I drove by and she started barking at me, I just stopped my bike and talked to the dog after many many chases I learned to do this. The dog would just stop barking look confused and after a few seconds (sometimes a minute or so) just walk away. I used to yell at her and say words in an angry tone but I soon learnt the best technique is to say some words in a calm soothing or loving tone. The dog still barked every time I or anyone else drove by.

Fast forward several years later, I started taking care of street dogs in my neighborhood (I take care of them to ensure they live safely). One of the dogs gave birth and had several puppies. Most of them survived and were adopted or grew up to adulthood but 2 of the puppies were run over by traffic and died before they could be treated. 2 of her daughters survived but were hit by water tankers and or speeding traffic and have one injured back leg. Whenever they see speeding vehicles in their street they chase and bark at them. 

It took way too long for me to learn that dogs have trauma and remember that they were injured by traffic and thus chase and bark at random vehicles if they are reminded of when they suffered an injury or loss. Dogs have memories and can suffer trauma just like people can. They learn to live with it for most part but sometimes a painful incident from the past triggers them and thus you have dogs chasing innocent motorists",1705857273.0,False,22,False

So, if people understand this and use the water carefully it'll be great. Government bodies must make sure there's no leaks in their connectivity and house owners must make sure their plumbing is top notch. Use limited water and don't abuse water as if its forever free flowing thing.

Many borewells are giving up due to over usage. Our lakes and rivers are being misused and land grabbing of lakes and convert into big ugly apartments has become a plague in our city. We as species only take from this mother earth but never give back equally ever. This greed one day will make us extinct :) 

We can fix this. Plant more trees sensibly & some organisation must do proper maintenance and create more water holding bodies like lakes and big ponds in every area.
